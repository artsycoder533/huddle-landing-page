## My process

For this challenge I examined the design picture given and thought about how it can be broken up into HTML elements so that it can then be manipulated with flexbox.  I used the mobile-first workflow and then scaled my design up based on the breakpoints i set for tablet and desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with svg backgrounds and also using to picture tag to toggle between images based on the screen size.


### Continued development

I would like to continue to practice creating resonsive websites and using media queries.  Right now imm currently working with just CSS flexbox, but soon I will be going back over css grid. I will also continue to practice using the mobile-first workflow, its getting easier to code for mobile and then scale up.



### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY8q4TD3KGM) - This Youtube Video by Joy Shaheb helped me get a better understanding of media queries.
- [Screenfly](https://screenfly.org/) - This website lets you preview what your website looks like on different screen sizes.  I prefer it over using chrome dev tools, becauese the proportions are more accurate in my opinion.  Sometimes dev tools makes it look distorted at certain dimensions.
